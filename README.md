# Featching_Api
Perfect 👍 **Fetching users from an API** is *the* best beginner React project.
I’ll keep this **super simple**, slow, and beginner-friendly.

---

## 🎯 What we’ll build (Beginner Project)

👉 A page that:

* Fetches users from an API
* Shows **Name, Email**
* Uses **useEffect + useState**
* No fancy CSS

API we’ll use (free & easy):
👉 `https://jsonplaceholder.typicode.com/users`

---

## 🧠 Concepts you’ll learn

* `useState` → store users
* `useEffect` → call API
* `fetch()` → get data
* `map()` → show list

---


## 🚨 Common Beginner Mistakes (Avoid these)

❌ Forget `[]` in useEffect → infinite loop
❌ Forget `key` in map
❌ Try to `map` before data arrives

You’re doing great 💪 Keep going!
